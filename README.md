# Customer Segmentation Project using RFM Analysis and Clustering Techniques

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, hierarchical clustering, and K-means clustering. The analysis is based on the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies. The project includes the following components:

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset.
- RFM analysis: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
- Clustering: Applying hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms to group customers into distinct segments.
- Visualization: Visualizing customer segments and RFM metrics using various plots and charts.
- Interpretation: Analyzing the results and providing actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Visualizations

The project includes visualizations for:

Elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters.
Distribution of RFM scores.
Pairplot of RFM metrics with K-means clusters.
3D scatter plot of RFM metrics with clusters.
